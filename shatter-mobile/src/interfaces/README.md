# Interfaces (Frontend Data Models)

This folder stores TypeScript interfaces and types that define the data structures used across the application, especially for:

- API request and response models
- Page-level data types
- Shared domain models (User, Event, etc.)

## Structure

Organize interfaces by feature or API endpoint.

Example:
- `User.tsx`
- `GetUserEventsResponse.tsx`
- `EventApplyRequest.tsx`
