## Event States

### State Enum

The `currentState` field on the Event model is a **validated enum** with three possible values:

```js
// event_model.ts
currentState: {
  type: String,
  enum: ['Upcoming', 'In Progress', 'Completed'],
  default: 'Upcoming',
  required: true
}
```

| State         | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `Upcoming`    | Event created, waiting for host to start. Participants can join. |
| `In Progress` | Event is live. Games/activities are in progress. Participants can still join (unless at capacity). |
| `Completed`   | Event is over. No new joins. Results are finalized. |

These values match the mobile app's `EventState` enum exactly (title case with spaces).

### State Diagram

```
Upcoming ──► In Progress ──► Completed
```

- Only forward transitions are allowed
- There is no way to revert a state (e.g., `Completed` cannot go back to `In Progress`)
- Events are created with `currentState: 'Upcoming'` by default

## Transition Rules

### Valid Transitions

| From          | To             | Who Can Trigger    | Endpoint |
|---------------|----------------|--------------------|----------|
| `Upcoming`    | `In Progress`  | Event creator only | `PUT /api/events/:eventId/status` |
| `In Progress` | `Completed`    | Event creator only | `PUT /api/events/:eventId/status` |

Invalid transitions (e.g., `Completed` → `In Progress`, `Upcoming` → `Completed`) are rejected with a `400` error.

### Transition Endpoint: `PUT /api/events/:eventId/status`

**Auth:** Protected (event creator only — `event.createdBy === req.user.userId`)

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "status": "In Progress"
}
```

**Validation:**
- Only the user in `createdBy` can change the state (403 for non-host)
- Only valid transitions are allowed (400 for invalid transitions)
- The `status` field is required (400 if missing)

**Success Response (200):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "event": {
    "_id": "665a...",
    "name": "Tech Meetup",
    "currentState": "In Progress",
    ...
  }
}
```

**Error Responses:**

| Status | Error |
|--------|-------|
| 400    | `"Status is required"` |
| 400    | `"Invalid status transition from <current> to <target>"` |
| 403    | `"Only the event host can update the event status"` |
| 404    | `"Event not found"` |

### Side Effects Per Transition

#### `Upcoming` → `In Progress`
- Triggers Pusher event `event-started` on channel `event-{eventId}`
- Payload: `{ status: 'In Progress' }`
- Frontend should transition from lobby/waiting UI to active game UI

#### `In Progress` → `Completed`
- Triggers Pusher event `event-ended` on channel `event-{eventId}`
- Payload: `{ status: 'Completed' }`
- Frontend should show results/summary screen

## Current Event Endpoints and State

| Endpoint | State Behavior |
|----------|---------------|
| `POST /api/events/createEvent` | Sets `currentState` to `'Upcoming'` by default (can be overridden with a valid enum value) |
| `GET /api/events/:eventId` | Returns `currentState` as-is |
| `GET /api/events/event/:joinCode` | Returns `currentState` as-is |
| `PUT /api/events/:eventId/status` | Validates and transitions `currentState` (host-only) |
| `POST /api/events/:eventId/join/user` | Does **not** check `currentState` |
| `POST /api/events/:eventId/join/guest` | Does **not** check `currentState` |

---

## What's Allowed in Each State (Planned)

| Action | `Upcoming` | `In Progress` | `Completed` |
|--------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Join event | Yes | Yes (if not full) | No |
| Leave event | Yes | Yes | No |
| View participants | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Play bingo / activities | No | Yes | No |
| Update bingo grid | No | Yes | No |
| View results | No | No | Yes |
| Create connections | No | Yes | No |

---

## Frontend Integration Notes

### UI State Mapping

| `currentState` | Suggested UI |
|----------------|-------------|
| `Upcoming`     | Lobby / waiting room. Show participant list, join code, QR code. "Waiting for host to start..." |
| `In Progress`  | Game screen. Show bingo grid, active activities, connection creation. |
| `Completed`    | Results screen. Show final scores, connections made, event summary. |

### Subscribing to State Changes

Subscribe to Pusher events on the event channel to react to state transitions in real time:

```js
const channel = pusher.subscribe(`event-${eventId}`);

channel.bind('event-started', (data) => {
  // data.status === 'In Progress'
  // Transition UI from lobby to active game
  setEventState('In Progress');
});

channel.bind('event-ended', (data) => {
  // data.status === 'Completed'
  // Transition UI from active game to results
  setEventState('Completed');
});
```
